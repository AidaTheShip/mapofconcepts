# MAP OF KNOWLEDGE

This open-source project aims to unify and conceptualize current-day human knowledge. The aim is to show interconnections between fields (cross-disciplinarity).
We start with a fundamental physics approach in describing the world and work our way up towards our beautifully emergent world out of it. 
As time passes, we hope that people add more interconnections between the microscopic and the macroscopic to this projects as well as knowledge. 

We hope that through mapping out our current systems and ecologies as a whole, we will gain a greater understanding and meaning of the forest that we are currently in.

## Epistemology
Talking about knowledge, we cannot disregard the need to talk about epistemology. 

> In different parts of its extensive history, different facets of epistemology have attracted attention. Plato’s epistemology was an attempt to understand what it was to know, and how knowledge (unlike mere true opinion) is good for the knower. Locke’s epistemology was an attempt to understand the operations of human understanding, Kant’s epistemology was an attempt to understand the conditions of the possibility of human understanding, and Russell’s epistemology was an attempt to understand how modern science could be justified by appeal to sensory experience. Much recent work in formal epistemology is an attempt to understand how our degrees of confidence are rationally constrained by our evidence, and much recent work in feminist epistemology is an attempt to understand the ways in which interests affect our evidence, and affect our rational constraints more generally.
