# MAP OF KNOWLEDGE

This is an open-source project that aims to unify and conceptualize current-day human knowledge. The aim is to show interconnections between fields (cross-disciplinarity).
We start with a fundamental physics approach in describing the world and work our way up towards our beautifully emergent world out of it. 
As time passes, we hope that people add more interconnections between the microscopic and the macroscopic to this projects as well as knowledge. 

We hope that through mapping out our current systems and ecologies as a whole, we will gain a greater understanding and meaning of the forest that we are currently in.
